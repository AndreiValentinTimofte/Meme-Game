# Meme Game
Design and implement a web application for playing a single-player version of the "What do you
meme?" board game.
#
In the game, the player receives a random meme picture and seven possible captions for that meme.

The player needs to guess the “right” caption for the meme.
The game is based on an archive of several meme pictures. Each meme picture is associated with exactly 3 “right” captions that best match the picture, and each of them is associated with a number
of points the player will gain. Specifically, one caption is worth 1 point, another 2 points, and another
3 points. It is possible for a caption to be associated with more than one picture. Students are free to
use the memes and the captions they prefer.
#
The gameplay works in several rounds. Each round proposes a meme, as follows:
1. The player receives a random meme picture and seven possible captions for that meme in
random order. Both the random meme picture and the captions must be generated by the
server. Among the seven captions, the three “right” ones must appear.
2. The player must select a caption that best fits the meme.
3. If the player selects one of the most appropriate captions for the meme, they get the
associated points and a message reports the end of the round and the amount of points
gained.
4. If the player selects one of the other captions, they get 0 points. In this case, the application
shows a suitable message together with the two captions that are the best match for the
given meme.

Logged-in users will play a game composed of 3 rounds. In addition, all their games and rounds are
recorded at the end of the game, the history of their scores is visible in the user profile page. The
history should show all meme pictures, with their obtained score, the score for the game, and thetotal score of all games.

The same meme cannot be repeated in different rounds of the same game, but it might be repeated in different games.

After 3 rounds, the game stops, and the total score of this game is displayed, together with a summary of the correctly matched memes and their selected captions. If the game is not completed
by the user, it is not recorded, and no points are assigned.

Anonymous users, instead, may only play one-round games. They won’t have access to any functionality of registered users.

After the end of the game, the player may restart a new game.

Logged users can create new associations of meme pictures (already contained in the database) and captions (new or existing), also defining the associated points.

The organization of these specifications in different screens (and possibly on different routes) is left to the student.

### Database Schema
The database for the Meme Game project consists of three main tables:

**1. `memes` table**
- **`id`**: INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY - Unique identifier for the meme picture.
- **`url`**: TEXT - File path or URL to the meme image.
- **`description`**: TEXT - A brief description of the meme.

**2. `captions` table**
- **`id`**: INTEGER, PRIMARY KEY - Unique identifier for the caption.
- **`text`**: TEXT - The actual text of the caption.

**3. `associations` table**
- **`memeId`**: INTEGER - Foreign key referencing `memes.id`.
- **`captionId`**: INTEGER - Foreign key referencing `captions.id`.
- **`points`**: INTEGER - The score assigned for this specific meme-caption association (1, 2, or 3).
- **PRIMARY KEY**: (`memeId`, `captionId`)
